+ Add the interface concept:
  Basically a struct with only functions. Change every code on egueb
  enesim or whatever that requires such thing. Basically remove
  every non function member
+ Add a way to notify when a parameter is a closure
+ Add a way to inform how the callback is going to be called:
  immediately, later
+ Add support for constants
+ Add support for lists types
+ Add support for hash types
+ Add support for arrays types
+ To simplify the bindings we might get the symbol directly by API
  and make the xml have a symname attribute, to avoid deducing it
  eveyrtime
